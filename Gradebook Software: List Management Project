#Gradebook Software: List Management Project

#print functions will be turned to "comments" once the software is updated that incorporate changes to the list.

# Your code below: 
last_semester_gradebook = [["politics", 80], ["latin", 96], ["dance", 97], ["architecture", 65]]

#create a list of courses. Assign the values into a variable called "subject"
subject = ["physics", "calculus", "poetry", "history"]
#print(subject)

#create a list of of scores. Assign the values into a variable called "grades"
grades = [98, 97, 85, 88]
#print(grades)

#Take the values from both list and create a 2 dimensional list. Assign the values into a variable called "gradebook"
gradebook = [["physics", 98], ["calculus", 97], ["poetry", 85], ["history", 88]]
#print(gradebook)

#computer science grade just came in, I achieved an 100% in the class, Time to insert this information into the system.
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])
#print(gradebook)

#Another class grade was just entered "visual arts", I achieved a 93.
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])
#print(gradebook)

#Our "visual arts" grade was incorrectedly updated so we actually have 5 more points than before. 
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 98])
#print(gradebook)

gradebook[2].remove(85)
#print(gradebook)

#Need to locate our "poetry" class because the grading has switched from number-based to "Pass" or "Fail", I Passed!
gradebook[2].append("Pass")
#print(gradebook)

#Lets combined our last semster with the current information for this semster's gradebook
full_gradebook = last_semester_gradebook + gradebook

print(full_gradebook)
