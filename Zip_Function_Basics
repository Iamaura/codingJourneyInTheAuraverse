#Zip Function:
names = ["Jenny", "Alexus", "Sam", "Grace"]
heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]

names_and_heights = zip(names, heights)
print(names_and_heights)

converted_list = list(names_and_heights)
print(converted_list)

#Zip Function Practice:

owners = ["Jenny", "Alexus", "Sam", "Grace"]
dogs_names = ["Elphonse", "Dr. Doggy DDS", "Carter", "Ralph"]

names_and_dogs_names = zip(owners, dogs_names)

list_of_names_and_dogs_names = list(names_and_dogs_names)

print(list_of_names_and_dogs_names)
